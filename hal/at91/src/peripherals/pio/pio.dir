/// \dir
///
/// !!!Purpose
///
/// This directory contains an API for configuring the Peripheral Input/Output
/// (PIO) controllers.
///
/// !!!Contents
///
/// The code is separated into two components:
///    - pio.c contains code for PIO initialisation, as well as set/clear/get
///      methods that can be used with user-controlled pins.
///    - pio_it.h provides a convenient interface for configuring, enabling or
///      disabling interrupts on one pin or a group of pins.
///
/// The reasoning behing this division is that pio_it.c requires the aic
/// peripheral, which generates useless includes for project which do not use
/// PIO interrupts.
