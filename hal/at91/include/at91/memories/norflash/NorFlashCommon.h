/// !Purpose
/// 
/// The Hardware Adaptation Layer manages the hardware functions of the %NORFLASH
/// %Flash. It implements a low level driver to manage the hardware functionality 
/// of %NORFLASH.
/// 
/// !Usage
///  
/// -# WriteRawData() is used to write data to the %NorFlash device.
/// -# ReadRawData() is used to read data from the %NorFlash device.
/// -# The specified address for read/write operation is an linear byte
///    address of target application byte address space represented by
///    WORD((8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit). The start (base) address of the 
///    flash memory in this address space is defined in board.h file 
///    as BOARD_NORFLASH_BASE_ADDR and users might need to change it.
/// -# WriteCommand() is used to write a command to specified command 
///    address.
/// 
///  ! NorFlash Error Codes
///
/// It provides detailed error codes to describe the various errors 
/// that may occur during the operation. Some functions return an error
/// number directly as the function value. These functions return a value
/// of zero (NorCommon_ERROR_NONE) to indicate a success.
