/// \unit
///
/// !!!Purpose
/// 
/// The API layer consists of several functions that allow user to do 
/// operations with flash in a unified way. As a result, future device changes 
/// will not necessarily lead to the code changes in the application environments.
/// In this %norflash library we support AMD and INTEL command set.
/// The API layar code accesses the Flash memory by calling the low-level code, 
/// so users do not have to concern themselves with the details of the special 
/// command sequences.
/// 
/// !!!Usage
/// 
/// !!!Usage
/// -# Flash program using NORFLASH_WriteData().
///    - The Program command is used to modify the data stored at the 
///      specified device address. 
/// -# erase a block within the flash using NORFLASH_EraseSector().
///    - Flash erase is performed on a block basis. An entire block is 
///      erased each time an erase command sequence is given. 
/// -# erase whole blocks within the flash using NORFLASH_EraseChip().
/// -# NORFLASH_Reset() function can be issued, between Bus Write cycles 
///    before the start of a program or erase operation, to return the 
///    device to read mode.
/// -# NORFLASH_ReadDeviceID() is used to retrieve information 
///    about the Flash Device type.
/// -# NORFLASH_ReadManufactoryID() is used to retrieve information 
///    about the Flash Device Manufactory ID.
