///
/// !!!Purpose
/// 
/// The AMD %norflash Low-level driver code implement procedures to program 
/// basic operations described AMD-specified command set flash devices. 
/// The various commands recognized by the devices are listed in the Commands 
/// Tables provided in the corresponding AMD command set compatible flash 
/// datasheets. All operation functions are blocked, they wait for the 
/// completion of an operation by polling the status register.
///
/// !!!Usage
/// -# Flash program using AMD_Write_Data().
///    - The Program command is used to modify the data stored at the 
///      specified device address. Programming can only change bits 
///      from ¡®1¡¯ to ¡®0¡¯. It may be necessary to erase the block before 
///      programming to addresses within it. Programming modifies a single 
///      Word at a time using static function amd_Program(). Programming 
///      larger amounts of data must be done in one Word at a time by 
///      giving a Program command, waiting for the command to complete, 
///      giving the next Program command and so on.
/// -# erase a block within the flash using AMD_EraseSector().
///    - Flash erase is performed on a block basis. An entire block is 
///      erased each time an erase command sequence is given. 
/// -# erase whole blocks within the flash using AMD_EraseChip().
/// -# AMD_Reset() function can be issued, between Bus Write cycles 
///    before the start of a program or erase operation, to return the 
///    device to read mode.
/// -# AMD_ReadDeviceID() is used to retrieve information 
///    about the Flash Device type.
/// -# AMD_ReadManufactoryId() is used to retrieve information 
///    about the Flash Device Manufactory ID.
