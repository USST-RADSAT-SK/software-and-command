/// \dir
/// !!!Purpose
///
/// This directory provides a library of highly re-usable code to build
/// applications on Atmel AT91 microcontrollers.
///
/// !!!Contents
/// AT91LIB can basically be divided into two sections:
///    - Board-dependant definitions and routines
///    - Re-usable & portable software modules
///
/// Board-specific code is entirely located in the #board# subdirectory. The
/// second group is then split into several sub-directories, depending on 
/// the nature of the software module. Currently, the following directories
/// are defined:
///    - memories
///    - peripherals
///    - utility
///
/// For more information about what a particular group contains, please refer to
/// its documentation page.
///
/// \note Depending on the project, not all the subdirectories will be
/// available (i.e. the #usb# directory will not be in non-USB projects).
